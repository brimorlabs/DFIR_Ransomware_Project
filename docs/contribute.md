# Expanding an Existing Family
1. Make a fork of the [repo](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project).
2. Make a branch (optional). 
3. Edit the file in the [docs/families/](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project/blob/main/docs/families/) folder.
5. Ensure any changes you make have a corresponding reference. We want to give credit to the original authors. Multiple rows can refer to the same reference. 
6. Make a pull request.

# Expanding The Common Methods
Same as above, except edit [docs/common.md](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project/blob/main/docs/common.md). 


# Adding a New Family
1. Make a fork of the [repo](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project).
2. Make a branch (optional). 
3. Make a copy of [docs/families/template.md](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project/blob/main/docs/families/template.md)  and name it docs/families/FAMILY.md where you replace FAMILY with a unique name of the ransomware type.
4. Edit the top part of the file to add the title and URL. There are TODO instructions for each step. You can delete the TODO lines.
5. Fill in the table in the file and include a reference for each entry. Multiple rows can refer to the same reference. 
6. If you do not have data for one of the categories, then leave it as TBD. Use "None" or "No" instead of an empty entry. 
7. Make a pull request.
