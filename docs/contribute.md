Help maintain this repo by doing XYZ


POLISH UP, but here are quick steps:

1. Make a fork of the [repo](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project).
2. Make a branch (optional). 
3. Make a copy of [docs/families/template.md](https://github.com/cybertriage/DFIR_Ransomware_Project/blob/main/docs/families/template.md)  and name it docs/families/FAMILY.md where you replace FAMILY with a unique name of the ransomware type.
4. Edit the top part of the file to add the title and URL. There are TODO instructions for each step. You can delete the TODO lines.
5. Fill in the table in the file and include a reference for each entry. Multiple rows can refer to the same reference. 
6. Make a pull request.
