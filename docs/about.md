This project was started by Brian Carrier ([Cyber Triage](https://cybertriage.com)) and Brian Moran ([BriMor Labs](https://brimorlabs.com)) as a way to have an easy reference for the various ransomware families.  This framework and the first set of families was presented at [ResponderCon 2022](https://respondercon.io). 

The plan is to continue to maintain this site as a community reference and identify ways to incorporate the data into DFIR tools.
